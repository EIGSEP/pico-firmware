"""
Redis bus surfaces owned by picohost.

Mirrors the ``CorrWriter`` / ``CorrReader`` / ``CorrConfigStore``
pattern in ``eigsep_observing.corr``: each class takes an
``eigsep_redis.Transport`` at construction, and the concerns are
split into the smallest stable surface per bus.

Six buses here:

- :class:`PicoConfigStore` — persistent single-key blob holding the
  list of picos (app id, serial port, usb serial) written once by
  ``flash-picos`` and read on manager boot as the source of truth.
- :class:`PotCalStore` — persistent single-key blob holding the
  potentiometer calibration (voltage-to-angle slope/intercept for
  both pots). Written by ``calibrate-pot`` and read by
  :class:`picohost.PicoPotentiometer` at startup so a rebooted
  pot Pico picks up its cal from Redis without a local JSON file.
- :class:`MotorPositionStore` — persistent single-key blob holding
  the motor's last known step positions and the firmware
  ``boot_id`` they belong to. Written by
  :class:`picohost.PicoMotor`'s redis handler on every position
  change and read back to re-seed the firmware step counters after
  a pico power cycle (positions live in RAM and reset to 0).
- :class:`PicoCmdReader` — blocking reader for the pico command
  stream. Consumed by the manager's command-relay thread.
- :class:`PicoRespWriter` — writer for the pico response stream.
  Every command yields exactly one response entry, correlated by
  ``request_id``.
- :class:`PicoClaimStore` — TTL-backed soft claims for per-device
  ownership. Claims are advisory and the stream reader never
  rejects a command for claim reasons; the store exists so a
  consumer that wants to coordinate can see who currently holds
  a device.

Per-device liveness is tracked via
``eigsep_redis.HeartbeatWriter(transport, name=pico_heartbeat_name(dev))``
— one heartbeat key per pico. There is no picohost-owned heartbeat
class because the eigsep_redis surface already fits.
